# Cross-lagged-multi-level
Mplus code for Cross-lagged multi-level models with Bayesian estimator.

Mediation analysis using Multi-level models with lagged effects to estimate potentially causal processes has been a challenge for researchers. For instance see [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-017-0979-2) highlighted some of the issues with the use of latent variable models in this context. Capitalizing on development of Dynamic Structural Equation Modelling Module in Mplus this is a syntax that aims towards estimation of a cross-lagged multi-level model with Bayesian estimator. The CL MLM model covers the case of multiple mediators, while the CL MLM2 is an extension of the base model with time varying and time invariant predictors.
