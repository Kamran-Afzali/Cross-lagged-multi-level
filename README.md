MPLUS code for Cross-lagged multi-level with two mediators and Bayesian estimator
Mediation analysis using Multi-level models with lagged effects to estimate potentially causal processes has been a challenge for researchers. For instance see https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-017-0979-2. Capitalizing on development of Dynamic Structural Equation Modelling Module in Mplus this is a syntax that aims towards estimation of a cross-lagged multi-level model with two mediators and Bayesian estimator.
