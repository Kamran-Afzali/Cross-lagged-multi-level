# -Bayesian-Gaussian-Graphical-Models-Stability-and-Accuracy
A bootnet like non parametric bootstrapping stability analysis of a BGGM model.

Bayesian Graphical Gaussian Models is a new development in non regularized Graphical Model Estimation with several potential implementations in social/psychological sciences. The code presented here is integration of non-parametric bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals and stability of BGGMs.
